1. Basic Information:
   - Student ID: 00001651789
   - Student Name: Sudarshan Mehta
   - OS (bit): Mac OS Sonoma 64-bit
   - gcc version: Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5)

2. Meta-data:
   - Tables Table:
     - Columns:
       - `table_id`: INT
       - `table_name`: VARCHAR(50)
       - `file_name`: VARCHAR(50)
       - `system`: INT
   - Columns Table:
     - Columns:
       - `table_id`: INT
       - `column_name`: VARCHAR(50)
       - `column_type`: INT
       - `column_length`: INT
       - `column_position`: INT

3. Internal Record Format:
   - The design employs a straightforward format where each field is stored sequentially in memory within the record. This structure ensures O(1) field access as the offset for each field is pre-computed based on the field's position in the record.
   - VarChar Field Storage: VarChar fields are stored with a 4-byte integer prefix indicating the length of the string followed by the actual string data. This format allows efficient retrieval and storage of variable-length string data.
   - Update and Delete Handling: Updates are performed by directly modifying the record data in place. Deletes are handled by marking the record as deleted or by physically removing it from the page/file and updating the relevant metadata accordingly.

4. Page Format:
   - The page format consists of a fixed-size array of bytes (PAGE_SIZE) to store data records. Each record is stored contiguously within the page, and the page header contains metadata such as the number of records and their offsets within the page.
   - Update and Delete Handling: Updates to records on a page are handled by overwriting the existing record data with the new data. Deletes may involve shifting records to fill the gap left by the deleted record or marking the record as deleted without physically removing it.

5. File Format:
   - The file format follows a simple structure where pages are appended sequentially within the file. Each page contains a fixed-size array of bytes to store record data along with a page header containing metadata.
   - The file format allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data records while supporting operations like updates and deletes at the page level.

6. Implementation Detail:
   - Field Access Optimization: Utilizing pre-computed offsets for fields in records ensures O(1) field access time.
   - Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are implemented throughout the codebase to handle various failure scenarios gracefully.
   - Resource Management: Proper resource management techniques are employed to prevent memory leaks and resource contention, ensuring robust and efficient operation of the file and record managers.

7. Other (optional):
   - The implementation focuses on efficiency and scalability, allowing the database system to handle large datasets and concurrent access efficiently.
   - Indexing mechanisms, such as B-trees or hash indexes, can be implemented to improve query performance and data retrieval speed.
   - Consideration is given to future extensibility, allowing the addition of advanced features like query optimization and distributed database support.
